# Memory Game

One of the first projects I made while learning React.

I recently began sifting through the code and updating the logic so that it actually worked.

Won't be featured on the New York Times games section, just made to demonstrate my somewhat decent knowledge of TS and React.

## Features

- Interactive memory game
- Reset functionality
- Accessible for screen readers and keyboard navigation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
